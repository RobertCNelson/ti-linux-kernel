description: |
  Some K3 family SoCs have  Arm Cortex M4F cores. AM64x is a SoC in K3
  family with a M4F core. Typically safety oriented applications may use
  the M4F core in isolation with out an IPC. Where as some Industrial and
  home automation applications, may use the M4F core as a remote processor
  with IPC communications.
