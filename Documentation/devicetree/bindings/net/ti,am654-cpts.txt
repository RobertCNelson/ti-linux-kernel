TI AM65x SoC The Common Platform Time Sync (CPTS) module Device Tree Bindings
------------------------------------------------------

The CPTS module is used to facilitate host control of time sync operations.
Main features of CPTS module are:
- Supports the selection of multiple external clock sources
- Software control of time sync events via interrupt or polling
- Supports hardware timestamp push inputs (HWx_TS_PUSH)
- Supports timestamp counter compare output (TS_COMP)
- Supports timestamp counter bit output (TS_SYNC)
- Supports timestamp Generator function outputs (TS_GENFx)
- Supports 64-bit timestamp mode in ns with ppm and nudge adjustment.
Depending on integration it enables compliance with the IEEE 1588-2008 standard
for a precision clock synchronization protocol, Ethernet Enhanced Scheduled
Traffic Operations (CPTS_ESTFn) and PCIe Subsystem Precision Time
Measurement (PTM)

TI AM65x SoC has several similar Time Sync (CPTS) modules integrated into the
different parts of the system which could be synchronized with each other:
- Main CPTS
- MCU CPSW CPTS with IEEE 1588-2008 support
- PCIe subsystem CPTS for PCIe Subsystem Precision Time Measurement (PTM)
  support

Properties:
- compatible	: Should be "ti,am65-cpts"  or
		  "ti,j721e-cpts"
- reg		: physical base address and size of the CPTS registers map
- reg-names	: should be "cpts"
	Depending on CPTS module integration and when CPTS is integral part of
	another module (MCU CPSW for example) "compatible" and "reg" can
	be omitted - parent module is fully responsible for CPTS enabling and
	configuration.
- clocks	: CPTS reference clock. Should point on cpts_refclk_mux clock.
- clock-names	: should be "cpts"
- interrupts-extended : CPTS events interrupt specifier
- interrupt-names : should be "cpts"

Required Sub-nodes:
- cpts_refclk_mux: CPTS reference clock multiplexer clock
	Required properties:
	- clocks : List of phandle and clock specifier pairs, one pair
		for each possible CPTS reference clock input
	- assigned-clocks : phandle on cpts_refclk_mux
	- assigned-clock-parents : phandle on selected CPTS reference clock
	Selection of CPTS reference clock expected to be done in board files.
	By default first listed clock will be selected as CPTS reference clock.

Optional properties:
- ti,cpts-periodic-outputs : Number of timestamp Generator function
		 outputs (TS_GENFx)
- ti,cpts-ext-ts-inputs : Number of hardware timestamp push inputs (HWx_TS_PUSH)
- ti,pps : pair of HWx_TS_PUSH input and TS_GENFy output indexes used for
	PPS events generation. Platform/board specific.
