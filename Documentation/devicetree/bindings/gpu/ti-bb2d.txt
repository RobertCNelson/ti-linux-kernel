* Texas Instruments BB2D blitter module

This binding describes the 2D BitBlit (BB2D) graphics accelerator
subsystem based on the GC320 core from Vivante Corporation available
in Texas Instruments SoCs.

Required properties:
  - compatible: should be "ti,dra7-bb2d" for TI DRA7xx/AM57xx SoCs
  - reg : base address and length of BB2D IP registers
  - interrupts : BB2D interrupt line number
  - ti,hwmods : name of the hwmod associated with BB2D module
  - clocks : handle to BB2D functional clock
  - clock-names : fck

Example:
        bb2d: bb2d@59000000 {
            compatible = "ti,dra7-bb2d";
            reg = <0x59000000 0x0700>;
            interrupts = <GIC_SPI 120 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
            ti,hwmods = "bb2d";
            clocks = <&dss_clkctrl DRA7_BB2D_CLKCTRL 0>;
            clock-names = "fck";
        };
