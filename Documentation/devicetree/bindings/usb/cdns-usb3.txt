Binding for the Cadence USBSS-DRD controller

Required properties:
  - reg: Physical base address and size of the controller's register areas.
	 Controller has 3 different regions:
	 region 1 - HOST registers area
	 region 2 - DEVICE registers area
	 region 3 - OTG/DRD registers area
  - reg-names - register memory area names:
	"xhci" - for HOST registers space
	"dev" - for DEVICE registers space
	"otg" - for OTG/DRD registers space
  - compatible: Should contain: "cdns,usb3-1.0.0" or "cdns,usb3-1.0.1"
  - interrupts: Interrupts used by cdns3 controller.

Optional properties:
 - maximum-speed : valid arguments are "super-speed", "high-speed" and
                   "full-speed"; refer to usb/generic.txt
 - dr_mode: Should be one of "host", "peripheral" or "otg".
 - phys: reference to the USB PHY

Example:
	usb@f3000000 {
		compatible = "cdns,usb3-1.0.1";
		interrupts = <USB_IRQ  7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		reg = <0xf3000000 0x10000	/* memory area for HOST registers */
			0xf3010000 0x10000	/* memory area for DEVICE registers */
			0xf3020000 0x10000>;	/* memory area for OTG/DRD registers */
		reg-names = "xhci", "dev", "otg";
	};
