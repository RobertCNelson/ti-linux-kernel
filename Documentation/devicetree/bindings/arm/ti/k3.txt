Texas Instruments K3 device tree bindings
-------------------------------------------

Boards based on the K3 family of SoCs shall have the following property:
- compatible: Every device present in K3 SoC shall be in the form:
  "ti,XXX-YYY", where:
     'XXX' represents the specific SoC part for which the support is added.
     'YYY' represents the corresponding peripheral in SoC being supported.
  NOTE: Generic devices such as GIC, NS16550 type UART shall use the specified
  compatible for those devices.

  Example:
    compatible = "ti,am654-i2c";

SoCs
-------------------------------------------

Each device tree root node must specify which exact K3 SoC it uses, using one
of the following compatible values:

- AM654
  compatible = "ti,am654";

Boards
-------------------------------------------

In addition, each device tree root node must specify which one or more of the
following board-specific compatible values:

- AM654 EVM
  compatible = "ti,am654-evm", "ti,am654";
