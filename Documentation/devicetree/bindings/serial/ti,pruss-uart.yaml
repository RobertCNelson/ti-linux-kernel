  The PRU-ICSS module has a serial UART peripheral, which is based on
  industry standard TL16C550, with 16-bytes TX/RX FIFOs.

      PRU interrupt mappings, containing an entry of 4 cell-values.
      The first is an index towards the 'prus' property to identify the PRU
      core for the interrupt map.
      The second is the PRU System Event id, which shall be the same as the
      'interrupt' property.
      The third is the PRU interrupt channel id.
      The fourth is the PRU host interrupt id.

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
