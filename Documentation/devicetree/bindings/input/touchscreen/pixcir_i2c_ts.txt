* Pixcir I2C touchscreen controllers

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "pixcir,pixcir_ts" or "pixcir,tangoc"
- reg: I2C address of the chip
- interrupts: interrupt to which the chip is connected
- attb-gpio: GPIO connected to the ATTB line of the chip
- x-size: horizontal resolution of touchscreen
- y-size: vertical resolution of touchscreen

Example:

	i2c@00000000 {
		/* ... */

		pixcir_ts@5c {
			compatible = "pixcir,tangoc";
			reg = <0x5c>;
			interrupts = <2 0>;

			attb-gpio = <&gpf 2 0 2>;
			reset-gpio = <&gpf 5 1 0>;

			x-size = <800>;
			y-size = <600>;
		};

		/* ... */
	};
