  TI am335x/am437x/dra7(am5)/dm814x CPSW3G Ethernet Subsystem supports
  two 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports with selectable G/MII, RMII, and RGMII interfaces.
  The interface mode is selected by configuring the MII mode selection register(s)
  (GMII_SEL) in the System Control Module chapter (SCM). GMII_SEL register(s) and
  bit fields placement in SCM are different between SoCs while fields meaning
  is the same.

  CPSW Port's Interface Mode Selection PHY describes MII interface mode between
  CPSW Port and Ethernet PHY which depends on Eth PHY and board configuration.
  |
  CPSW Port's Interface Mode Selection PHY device should defined as child device
  of SCM node (scm_conf) and can be attached to each CPSW port node using standard
  PHY bindings.

    description: |
      Required only for QSGMII mode. Array to select the port for
      QSGMII main mode. Rest of the ports are selected as QSGMII_SUB
      ports automatically. For J7200 CPSW5G with the compatible:
      ti,j7200-cpsw5g-phy-gmii-sel, ti,qsgmii-main-ports is an
      array of only one element, which is the port number ranging
      from 1 to 4. For J721E CPSW9G with the compatible:
      ti,j721e-cpsw9g-phy-gmii-sel, and
      For J784S4 CPSW9G with the compatible:
      ti,j784s4-cpsw9g-phy-gmii-sel, ti,qsgmii-main-ports is an
      array of two elements, which corresponds to two pairs of
      4 ports each. The first element and second element of the
      array both range from 1 to 4 each. However, for the second
      element, the values 1 to 4 map to the ports 5 to 8. Thus,
      it is possible to specify which port among the two different
      sets of 4 ports is the QSGMII main port. For example:
      ti,qsgmii-main-ports = <2>, <1>;
      would mean that of the 8 CPSW9G ports, ports 2 and 5 are the
      main ports for the two sets of QSGMII interfaces formend by
      ports 1-4 and ports 5-8. Both elements need to be filled
      if the property is being used. For example, if the first set of
      4 ports are configured for RGMII and the second set of 4 ports
      are configured for QSGMII with port 7 being the main port, then:
      ti,qsgmii-main-ports = <1>, <3>;
      is the correct value for this configuration. It does not matter
      what the first element's value is, but a valid value must be
      filled even if any of the first 4 ports are not being used in
      QSGMII mode.
