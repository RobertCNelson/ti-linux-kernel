PRU-ICSS on TI SoCs
===================

Binding status: Unstable - Subject to changes

The Programmable Real-Time Unit and Industrial Communication Subsystem
(PRU-ICSS) is present on various TI SoCs such as AM335x or AM437x or a
Keystone 66AK2G. A PRUSS consists of dual 32-bit RISC cores (Programmable
Real-Time Units, or PRUs), shared RAM, data and instruction RAMs, some
internal peripheral modules to facilitate industrial communication, and
an interrupt controller. The programmable nature of the PRUs provide
flexibility to implement custom peripheral interfaces, fast real-time
responses, or specialized data handling. The common peripheral modules
include the following,
  - an Ethernet MII_RT module with two MII ports
  - an MDIO port to control external Ethernet PHYs
  - an Industrial Ethernet Peripheral (IEP) to manage/generate Industrial
    Ethernet functions
  - an Enhanced Capture Module (eCAP)
  - an Industrial Ethernet Timer with 7/9 capture and 16 compare events
  - a 16550-compatible UART to support PROFIBUS

A PRU-ICSS subsystem can have up to three shared data memories. A PRU core
acts on a primary Data RAM (there are usually 2 Data RAMs) at its address
0x0, but also has access to a secondary Data RAM (primary to the other PRU
core) at its address 0x2000. A shared Data RAM, if present, can be accessed
by both the PRU cores. The Interrupt Controller (INTC) and a CFG module are
common to both the PRU cores. Each PRU core also has a private instruction RAM,
and specific register spaces for Control and Debug functionalities.

Various sub-modules within a PRU-ICSS subsystem are represented as individual
nodes and are defined using a parent-child hierarchy depending on their
integration within the IP and the SoC. These nodes are described in the
following sections.


PRU-ICSS SoC Bus Parent Node
=============================
This node represents the integration of the PRU-ICSS IP into a SoC, and is
required for all SoCs. The PRU-ICSS parent nodes need to be defined as child
nodes of this node.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible     : should be one of,
                       "ti,am3356-pruss-soc-bus" for AM335x family of SoCs

                   dictating the interconnect configuration
- #address-cells : should be 1
- #size-cells    : should be 1
- ranges         : standard ranges definition using addresses from 0 for child
                   nodes

SoC-specific Required properties:
---------------------------------

The following are mandatory properties for all OMAP-architecture based SoCs:
- ti,hwmods      : name of the hwmod associated with the PRUSS instance

The following properties are _required_ only for Keystone 2 66AK2G and K3 AM65x
SoCs:
- power-domains  : Should contain a phandle to a PM domain provider node and an
                   args specifier containing the PRUSS SCI device id value. This
                   property is as per the binding,
                       Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/ti/sci-pm-domain.txt


PRU-ICSS Parent Node
=====================
Each PRU-ICSS subsystem instance is represented as a child node of
the PRUSS SoC bus node, with the individual PRU processor cores, a
memories node, an INTC node and an MDIO node represented as child nodes
within this parent PRUSS node.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible     : should be one of,
                       "ti,am3356-pruss" for AM335x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am4376-pruss" for AM437x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am5728-pruss" for AM57xx family of SoCs
                       "ti,k2g-pruss" for 66AK2G family of SoCs
                       "ti,am654-icssg" for K3 AM65x family of SoCs
- reg            : base address and size of the entire PRU-ICSS space
- interrupts     : all the interrupts generated towards the main host
                   processor in the SoC. The format depends on the
                   interrupt specifier for the particular SoC's MPU
                   parent interrupt controller
- interrupt-names: should use one of the following names for each interrupt,
                   the name should match the corresponding host interrupt
                   number,
                       "host2", "host3", "host4", "host5", "host6",
                       "host7", "host8" or "host9"
                   NOTE: AM437x and 66AK2G SoCs do not have "host7" interrupt
                         connected to MPU
- #address-cells : should be 1
- #size-cells    : should be 1
- ranges         : no specific range translations required, child nodes have the
                   same address view as the parent, so should be mentioned without
                   any value for the property


PRU-ICSS Memories Node
=======================
The various Data RAMs within a PRU-ICSS are represented as a single
node with the name 'memories'.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- reg            : base address and size for each of the Data RAMs as
                   mentioned in reg-names, and in the same order as the
                   reg-names
- reg-names      : should contain a string from among the following names,
                   each representing a specific Data RAM region. A PRU-ICSS may
                   not have all of the Data RAMs. The binding is agnostic
                   of the order of these reg-names
                       "dram0" for Data RAM0,
                       "dram1" for Data RAM1,
                       "shrdram2" for Shared Data RAM,


PRU-ICSS SysCon Nodes
======================
The individual sub-modules CFG, IEP and MII_RT are represented as a syscon
node each with specific node names as below:
                  "cfg" for CFG sub-module,
                  "iep" for IEP sub-module,
                  "mii_rt" for MII-RT sub-module,

The following sub-modules are new and present only on ICSSG IP instances and
are applicable only for K3 SoCs. They are represented as follows:
	MII_G_RT sub-module: represent as a syscon node with name "mii_g_rt"

PRUSS INTC Child Node
======================
Each PRUSS has a single interrupt controller instance that is common to both
the PRU cores. Each interrupt controller can detect 64 input events which are
then mapped to 10 possible output interrupts through two levels of mapping. The
input events can be triggered by either the PRUs and/or various other PRUSS
internal and external peripherals.  The first 2 output interrupts are fed
exclusively to the internal PRU cores, with the remaining 8 connected to
external interrupt controllers including the MPU.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible           : should be one of,
                             "ti,am3356-pruss-intc" for AM335x family of SoCs
                             "ti,am4376-pruss-intc" for AM437x family of SoCs
                             "ti,am5728-pruss-intc" for AM57xx family of SoCs
                             "ti,k2g-pruss-intc" for 66AK2G family of SoCs
                             "ti,am654-icssg-intc" for K3 AM65x family of SoCs
- reg                  : base address and size for the PRUSS INTC sub-module
- reg-names            : should contain the string "intc"
- interrupt-controller : mark this node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells     : should be 1. Client users shall use the PRU System
                         event number (the interrupt source that the client
                         is interested in) as the value of the interrupts
                         property in their node


PRU Child Node
===============
Each PRUSS has dual PRU cores, each represented by a PRU child node. Each node
can optionally be rendered inactive by using the standard DT string property,
"status". K3 SoCs have two additional PRU cores called RTUs with slightly
different IP integration. Each RTU core can be used independently like a
PRU, or alongside a corresponding PRU core to provide/implement auxiliary
functionality/support.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- compatible     : should be
                       "ti,am3356-pru" for AM335x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am4376-pru" for AM437x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am5728-pru" for AM57xx family of SoCs
                       "ti,k2g-pru" for 66AK2G family of SoCs
                       "ti,am654-pru" for PRUs in K3 AM65x family of SoCs
                       "ti,am654-rtu" for RTUs in K3 AM65x family of SoCs
- reg            : base address and size for each of the 3 sub-module address
                   spaces as mentioned in reg-names, and in the same order as
                   the reg-names
- reg-names      : should contain each of the following 3 names, with the "iram"
                   entry being the first one
                       "iram" for Instruction RAM,
                       "control" for the CTRL sub-module registers,
                       "debug" for the Debug sub-module registers,
- firmware-name  : should contain the name of the default firmware image file
                   located on the firmware search path

Optional Properties:
--------------------
The virtio based communication between the MPU and a PRU core _requires_
either the 'mboxes' property, or the set of 'interrupt-parent', 'interrupts'
and 'interrupt-names' properties to be defined. The latter option is the
preferred choice. The 'mboxes' property is not applicable for 66AK2G SoCs.

- mboxes           : OMAP Mailbox specifier denoting the sub-mailbox, if using
                     a mailbox for IPC signalling between host and a PRU core.
                     The specifier format is as per the bindings,
                         Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mailbox/omap-mailbox.txt
                     This property should match with the sub-mailbox node used
                     in the corresponding firmware image.
- interrupt-parent : phandle to the PRUSS INTC node. Should be defined if
                     interrupts property is to be used.
- interrupts       : array of interrupt specifiers if using PRU system events
                     for IPC signalling between host and a PRU core. This
                     property should match with the PRU system event used in
                     the corresponding firmware image.
- interrupt-names  : should use one of the following names for each interrupt,
                     the name should match the corresponding PRU system event
                     number,
                         "vring" - for PRU to HOST virtqueue signalling
                         "kick"  - for HOST to PRU virtqueue signalling


MDIO Child Node
================
Each PRUSS has an MDIO module that can be used to control external PHYs. The
MDIO module used within the PRU-ICSS is an instance of the MDIO Controller
used in TI Davinci SoCs. Please refer to the corresponding binding document,
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/davinci-mdio.txt for details.


Application/User Nodes
=======================
A PRU application/user node typically uses one or more PRU device nodes to
implement a PRU application/functionality. Each application/client node would
need a reference to at least a PRU node, and optionally pass some configuration
parameters.

Required Properties:
--------------------
- prus                 : phandles to the PRU or RTU nodes used

Optional Properties:
--------------------
- firmware-name        : firmwares for the PRU cores, the default firmware
                         for the core from the PRU node will be used if not
                         provided. The firmware names should correspond to
                         the PRU cores listed in the 'prus' property
- ti,pruss-gp-mux-sel  : array of values for the GP_MUX_SEL under PRUSS_GPCFG
                         register for a PRU. This selects the internal muxing
                         scheme for the PRU instance. If not provided, the
                         default out-of-reset value (0) for the PRU core is
                         used. Values should correspond to the PRU cores listed
                         in the 'prus' property
- ti,pru-interrupt-map : PRU interrupt mappings, containing an array of entries
                         with each entry consisting of 4 cell-values. First one
                         is an index towards the "prus" property to identify the
                         PRU core for the interrupt map, second is the PRU
                         System Event id, third is the PRU interrupt channel id
                         and fourth is the PRU host interrupt id. If provided,
                         this map will supercede any other configuration
                         provided through firmware
