* Texas Instruments K3 NAVSS Unified DMA â€“ Peripheral Root Complex (UDMA-P)

The UDMA-P is intended to perform similar (but significantly upgraded) functions
as the packet-oriented DMA used on previous SoC devices. The UDMA-P module
supports the transmission and reception of various packet types. The UDMA-P is
architected to facilitate the segmentation and reassembly of SoC DMA data
structure compliant packets to/from smaller data blocks that are natively
compatible with the specific requirements of each connected peripheral. Multiple
Tx and Rx channels are provided within the DMA which allow multiple segmentation
or reassembly operations to be ongoing. The DMA controller maintains state
information for each of the channels which allows packet segmentation and
reassembly operations to be time division multiplexed between channels in order
to share the underlying DMA hardware. An external DMA scheduler is used to
control the ordering and rate at which this multiplexing occurs for Transmit
operations. The ordering and rate of Receive operations is indirectly controlled
by the order in which blocks are pushed into the DMA on the Rx PSI-L interface.

The UDMA-P also supports acting as both a UTC and UDMA-C for its internal
channels. Channels in the UDMA-P can be configured to be either Packet-Based or
Third-Party channels on a channel by channel basis.

- #dma-cells:		Should be set to <3>.
			- The first parameter is a phandle to the remote PSI-L
			  endpoint
			- The second parameter is the thread offset within the
			  remote thread ID range
			- The third parameter is the channel direction.
- reg:			Memory map of UDMAP
- reg-names:		"gcfg", "rchanrt", "tchanrt"

Within the PSI-L endpoint node thread configuration subnodes must present with:
ti,psil-configX naming convention, where X is the thread ID offset.

Configuration node Required properties:
--------------------

- enable-acc32:		Force 32 bit access on peripheral port. Only valid for
			XY type StaticTR, not supported on am654.
			Must be enabled for threads servicing McASP with AFIFO
			bypass mode.

			XY type StaticTR, not supported on am654.
- ti,channel-tpl:	Channel Throughput level:
			0 / or not present - normal channel
			1 - High Throughput channel
			2 - Ultra High Throughput channel (j721e only)
- ti,needs-epib:	If the endpoint require EPIB to be present in the
			descriptor.
- ti,psd-size:		Size of the Protocol Specific Data section of the
			descriptor.
- ti,notdpkt:		The Teardown Completion Message on the thread must be
