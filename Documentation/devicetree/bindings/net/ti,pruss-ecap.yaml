title: Texas Instruments PRU-ICSS Enhanced Capture (eCAP) event module

description: |
  Each PRUSS includes an Enhanced Capture (eCAP) module that can provide some
  time-stamp features using its capture input. The eCAP module used within the
  PRU-ICSS is similar to other instances used within the PWM subsystems. This
  is typically used for providing interrupt pacing for host traffic on various
  PRU Ethernet usecases such as Dual-EMAC, HSR or PRP.
