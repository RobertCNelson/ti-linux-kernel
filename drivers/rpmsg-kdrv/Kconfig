	  Say Y here to enable support for remote device based demo device.
	  This setup expects that the demo device server will be running on a
	  remoteproc and a client (sample) driver will be able to call demo device
	  APIs using remote_device framework.

	  The demo device is no real device. It serves the purpose of providing
	  a sample driver to be used as a reference for developing more
	  remote_device drivers (like display or ethernet)
