Texas Instruments DRA7x VIDEO PROCESSING ENGINE (VPE)
------------------------------------------------------

The Video Processing Engine (VPE) is a key component for image post
processing applications. VPE consist of a single memory to memory
path which can perform chroma up/down sampling, deinterlacing,
scaling and color space conversion.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "ti,vpe"
- reg:	physical base address and length of the registers set for the 8
	memory regions required;
- reg-names: name associated with the memory regions described is <reg>;
- interrupts: should contain IRQ line for VPE;

Example:
	vpe {
		compatible = "ti,vpe";
		ti,hwmods = "vpe";
		clocks = <&dpll_core_h23x2_ck>;
		clock-names = "fck";
		reg =	<0x489d0000 0x120>,
			<0x489d0700 0x80>,
			<0x489d5700 0x18>,
			<0x489dd000 0x400>;
		reg-names =	"vpe_top",
				"sc",
				"csc",
				"vpdma";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 354 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};
