Cadence MHDP bridge
==========================

The Cadence MHDP bridge is a DPI to DP bridge.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "cdns,mhdp8546",
  Use "ti,j721e-mhdp8546" for TI J7 SoCs.
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers,
- clocks: DP bridge clock, it's used by the IP to know how to translate
	a number of clock cycles into a time (which is used to comply
	with DP standard timings and delays),
- phys: see the Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/phy-cadence-torrent.txt
- phy-names: must be "dpphy"

Required subnodes:
- ports: Ports as described in Documentation/devictree/bindings/graph.txt
	Port 0 - input port representing the DP bridge input
	Port 1 - output port representing the DP bridge output

Example:

	mhdp: dp-bridge@f0fb000000 {
		compatible = "cdns,mhdp8546";
		reg = <0xf0 0xfb000000 0x0 0x1000000>;
		clocks = <&mhdp_clock>;
		phys = <&dp_phy>;
		phy-names = "dpphy";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				dp_bridge_input: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&xxx_dpi_output>;
				};
			};

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				dp_bridge_output: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&xxx_dp_connector_input>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
