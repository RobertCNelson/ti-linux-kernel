TI Keystone PCIe interface

Keystone PCI host Controller is based on the Synopsys DesignWare PCI
hardware version 3.65.  It shares common functions with the PCIe DesignWare
core driver and inherits common properties defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/designware-pci.txt

Please refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/designware-pci.txt
for the details of DesignWare DT bindings.  Additional properties are
described here as well as properties that are not applicable.

Required Properties:-

compatibility: Should be "ti,keystone-pcie" for RC
	       Should be "ti,keystone-pcie-ep" for EP
	       Should be "ti,am654-pcie-rc" for RC on AM654x SoC
	       Should be "ti,am654-pcie-ep" for EP on AM654x SoC

reg: Three register ranges as listed in the reg-names property
reg-names: "dbics" for the DesignWare PCIe registers, "app" for the
	   TI specific application registers, "config" for the
	   configuration space address for a device (used only in
	   RC mode) and "addr_space" used to map remote RC address space
	   (used only in EP mode).
interrupts: platform interrupt for error interrupts.
ti,syscon-pcie-id : phandle to the device control module required to set device
		    id and vendor id.
ti,syscon-pcie-mode : phandle to the device control module required to configure
		      PCI in either RC mode or EP mode.
num-ob-windows : number of outbound address translation window

HOST MODE
=========
pcie_msi_intc : Interrupt controller device node for MSI IRQ chip
	interrupt-cells: should be set to 1
	interrupt-parent: Parent interrupt controller phandle
	interrupts: GIC interrupt lines connected to PCI MSI interrupt lines
	(required if the compatible is "ti,keystone-pcie")
msi-map: As specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/pci-msi.txt
	 (required if the compatible is "ti,am654-pcie-rc".

num-ob-windows : number of outbound address translation window

 Example:
	pcie_msi_intc: msi-interrupt-controller {
			interrupt-controller;
			#interrupt-cells = <1>;
			interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 30 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
					<GIC_SPI 31 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
					<GIC_SPI 32 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
					<GIC_SPI 33 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
					<GIC_SPI 34 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
					<GIC_SPI 35 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
					<GIC_SPI 36 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
					<GIC_SPI 37 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
	};

pcie_intc: Interrupt controller device node for Legacy IRQ chip
	interrupt-cells: should be set to 1
	interrupt-parent: Parent interrupt controller phandle
	interrupts: GIC interrupt lines connected to PCI Legacy interrupt lines

 Example:
	pcie_intc: legacy-interrupt-controller {
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 26 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 27 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 28 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
			<GIC_SPI 29 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
	};

DesignWare DT Properties not applicable for Keystone PCI

1. pcie_bus clock-names not used.  Instead, a phandle to phys is used.

DEVICE MODE
===========
num-ib-windows : number of inbound address translation windows

Optional Properties:
max-link-speed: As defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/pci.txt
reset-gpios: GPIO spec for the PERST# signal (only host mode)
