* Texas Instrument K3 VTM bandgap bindings

In the Voltage Thermal Management Module(VTM), K3 supplies a voltage
reference and a temperature sensor feature that are gathered in the band
gap voltage and temperature sensor (VBGAPTS) module. The band
gap provides current and voltage reference for its internal
circuits and other analog IP blocks. The analog-to-digital
converter (ADC) produces an output value that is proportional
to the silicon temperature.

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be:
  - "ti,am654-vtm" : for K3 AM654 VTM bandgap
- reg: Base address and address range of the VTM registers
- power-domains  : Should contain a phandle to a PM domain provider node and an
                   args specifier containing the VTM device id value. This
                   property is as per the binding,
                       Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/ti/sci-pm-domain.txt
- #thermal-sensor-cells: Should be 1. See ./thermal.txt for a description

Example:

AM654:
wkup_vtm0: wkup_vtm0@42050000 {
	compatible = "ti,am654-vtm";
	reg = <0x0 0x42050000 0x0 0x25c>;
	power-domains = <&k3_pds 80>;
	#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>;
};
