 * used by fips140.ko but are not already built into it, due to them being
 * defined in a file that cannot easily be built into fips140.ko (e.g.,
 * crypto/algapi.c) instead of one that can (e.g., most files in lib/).
 *
 * There is no hard rule about what needs to be included here, as this is for
 * FIPS certifiability, not any technical reason.  FIPS modules are supposed to
 * implement the "crypto" themselves, but to do so they are allowed to call
 * non-cryptographic helper functions from outside the module.  Something like
 * memcpy() is "clearly" non-cryptographic.  However, there is is ambiguity
 * about functions like crypto_inc() which aren't cryptographic by themselves,
 * but are more closely associated with cryptography than e.g. memcpy().  To err
 * on the side of caution, we define copies of some selected functions below so
 * that calls to them from within fips140.ko will remain in fips140.ko.
