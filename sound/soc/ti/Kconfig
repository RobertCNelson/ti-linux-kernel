	  For HDMI audio to work OMAPDSS HDMI support should be
	  enabled.
	  The hdmi audio driver implements cpu-dai component using the
	  callbacks provided by OMAPDSS and registers the component
	  under DSS HDMI device. Omap-pcm is registered for platform
	  component also under DSS HDMI device. Dummy codec is used as
	  as codec component. The hdmi audio driver implements also
	  the card and registers it under its own platform device.
	  The device for the driver is registered by OMAPDSS hdmi
	  driver.

	  videophone.

	  Note that in order to get those devices fully supported,  you have to
	  build  the kernel  with  standard  serial port  driver  included  and
	  configured for at least 4 ports.  Then, from userspace, you must load
	  a line discipline #19 on the modem (ttyS3) serial line.  The simplest
	  way to achieve this is to install util-linux-ng  and use the included
	  ldattach  utility.  This  can be  started  automatically  from  udev,
	  a simple rule like this one should do the trick (it does for me):
	  	ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="controlC0", \
				RUN+="/usr/sbin/ldattach 19 /dev/ttyS3"
