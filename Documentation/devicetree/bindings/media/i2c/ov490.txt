* OmniVision OV490 CSI2 Image Signal Processor (ISP)

The Omnivision OV490 is a Image Signal Processor which is a companion
processor for the Raw image sensors. This device can process the raw images
and apply multiple algorithms to correct/transform/enhance the image quality.

It needs programming lot of registers are most of them are written from
a flash memory. The output is a CSI2 MIPI interface which can work with
configurable number of lanes.

Required Properties:
- compatible : "ovti,ov490"

Optional Properties:
- mux-gpios : A list of gpios with active high/low flags for enabling the sensor.
         This may contain gpios for power, board muxes, etc. Driver would
         set all of them as specified by the active high/low flag.

  There are no custom optional properties supported for this device.
  Although all the CSI2 endpoint properties documented in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt are supported.

Example:

	&i2c2 {
		...
		...
		ov490@cam0 {
			compatible = "ovti,ov490";
			reg = <0x24>;

			mux-gpios = <&gpio_csi2_adap 0  GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>,
				    <&gpio_csi2_adap 1  GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
				    <&gpio_csi2_adap 3  GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>,
				    <&gpio_csi2_adap 4  GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

			port {
				csi2_cam0: endpoint@0 {
					clock-lanes = <0>;
					data-lanes = <1 2 3 4>;
					remote-endpoint = <&csi2_phy0>;
				};
			};
		};
		...
	};
