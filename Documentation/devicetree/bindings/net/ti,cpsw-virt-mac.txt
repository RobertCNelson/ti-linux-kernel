TI J721E VIRT CPSWxg Ethernet mac
======================================

Required properties:
- compatible       : Should be "ti,j721e-cpsw-virt-mac" for J721E Family SoCs
- dma-coherent	: indicates that device operates with coherent memory.
- dmas		: list of UDMA controller channel specifiers [2]
- dma-names	: should be "tx0", "tx1", "tx2", "tx3", "tx4", "tx5", "tx6",
		"tx7", "rx";
- ti,psil-base : CPSWxg NUSS PSI-L endpoint thread ID base of the UDMA-P
		channels. The PSI-L endpoint node thread configuration
		subnodes must be present present with ti,psil-configX naming
		convention, where X is the thread ID offset [2].
- ti,remote-name: Name of the connected rpmsg-kdrv device represented
		by Eth switch FW running on the on of R5F cores.
		Should be "mpu_1_0_ethswitch-device-0" for J721E Family SoCs.

Required Sub-nodes:
- virt_emac_port: contains VIRT CPSWxg Ethernet mac port descriptions
	Optional properties - all ports:
	- ti,label : Describes the label associated with this port
	- local-mac-address: array of 6 bytes, the assigned MAC address [3].

The MAC address provided by Eth switch FW will be used if neither of
"mac-address" and "local-mac-address" is defined.
