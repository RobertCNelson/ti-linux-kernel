title: DMA-BUF contiguous buffer physical address user-space exporter binding

description: |
  Driver allowing user-space attaching of DMA-BUFs returning CPU physical
  addresses. The reasoning for making this act like a regular device
  described by DT is so the virtual device that binds the buffer can be
  made to act as if it is out on a bus or behind an IOMMU, for example.
