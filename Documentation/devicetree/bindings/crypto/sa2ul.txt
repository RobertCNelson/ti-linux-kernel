K3 SoC SA2UL crypto module

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be:
  - "ti,sa2ul-crypto"
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the module

- dmas: DMA specifiers for tx and rx dma. sa2ul needs one tx channel
	and 2 rx channels. First rx channel for < 256 bytes and
	the other one for >=256 bytes. See the DMA client binding,
        Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt
- dma-names: DMA request names has to have one tx and 2 rx names
	corresponding to dmas abive.

Example AM654 SA2UL:
crypto: crypto@4E00000 {
	compatible = "ti,sa2ul-crypto";
	reg = <0x0 0x4E00000 0x0 0x1200>;

	dma-names = "tx", "rx1", "rx2";
	dmas = <&main_udmap 0xc000>, <&main_udmap 0x4000>,
			<&main_udmap 0x4001>;
};
