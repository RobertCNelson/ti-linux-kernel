config GENERIC_PHY
	tristate "PHY Core"
	help
	  Generic PHY support.

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface for PHY
	  devices present in the kernel. This layer will have the generic
	  API by which phy drivers can create PHY using the phy framework and
	  phy users can obtain reference to the PHY. All the users of this
	  framework should select this config.

config OMAP_CONTROL_PHY
	tristate "OMAP CONTROL PHY Driver"
	help
	  Enable this to add support for the PHY part present in the control
	  module. This driver has API to power on the USB2 PHY and to write to
	  the mailbox. The mailbox is present only in omap4 and the register to
	  power on the USB2 PHY is present in OMAP4 and OMAP5. OMAP5 has an
	  additional register to power on USB3 PHY/SATA PHY/PCIE PHY
	  (PIPE3 PHY).

config OMAP_USB2
	tristate "OMAP USB2 PHY Driver"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	depends on USB_SUPPORT
	select GENERIC_PHY
	select USB_PHY
	select OMAP_CONTROL_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the transceiver that is part of SOC. This
	  driver takes care of all the PHY functionality apart from comparator.
	  The USB OTG controller communicates with the comparator using this
	  driver.

config OMAP_PIPE3
	tristate "OMAP PIPE3 PHY Driver"
	select GENERIC_PHY
	select OMAP_CONTROL_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the PIPE3 PHY that is part of SOC. This
	  driver takes care of all the PHY functionality apart from comparator.
	  This driver interacts with the "OMAP Control PHY Driver" to power
	  on/off the PHY.

config TWL4030_USB
	tristate "TWL4030 USB Transceiver Driver"
	depends on TWL4030_CORE && REGULATOR_TWL4030 && USB_MUSB_OMAP2PLUS
	depends on USB_SUPPORT
	select GENERIC_PHY
	select USB_PHY
	help
	  Enable this to support the USB OTG transceiver on TWL4030
	  family chips (including the TWL5030 and TPS659x0 devices).
	  This transceiver supports high and full speed devices plus,
	  in host mode, low speed.
