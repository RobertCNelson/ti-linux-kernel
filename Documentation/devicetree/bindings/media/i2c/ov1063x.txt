* OmniVision 8/10 bit digital camera

The Omnivision digital camera is a 720p camera which is configurable at 8/10bit
YUYV output and can be configured for various resolutions.

Required Properties:
- compatible : Must be one of the following
  - "ovti,ov10633": For OV10633 camera
  - "ovti,ov10635": For OV10635 camera
- clocks: reference to the xvclk input clock.
- clock-names: should be "xvclk".

Optional Properties:
- reset-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the reset pin, if any.
- powerdown-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the pwdn pin, if any.
- mux-gpios : A list of gpios with active high/low flags for enabling the
              sensor. This may contain gpios for power, board muxes, etc.
              Driver would set all of them as specified by the active
              high/low flag

  There are no custom optional properties supported for this device.
  Although all the endpoint properties documented in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt are supported.

Example:

	&i2c2 {
		...
		...
		ovcamera@30 {
			compatible = "ovti,ov10635";
			reg = <0x30>;

			clocks = <&clk_ov10635>;
			clock-names = "xvclk";

			mux-gpios = <&pcf_hdmi 3 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
			reset-gpios = <&gpio4 17 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
			powerdown-gpios = <&gpio5 11 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

			port {
				onboard_cam: endpoint {
					hsync-active = <1>;
					vsync-active = <1>;
					pclk-sample = <1>;
				};
			};
		};
		...
	};
