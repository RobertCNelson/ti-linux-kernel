Texas Instruments K3 Interrupt Aggregator
=========================================

The Interrupt Aggregator (INTA) provides a centralized machine
which handles the termination of system events to that they can
be coherently processed by the host(s) in the system. A maximum
of 64 events can be mapped to a single interrupt.

Configuration of these Intmap registers that maps global events to vint is done
by a system controller (like the Device Memory and Security Controller on K3
AM654 SoC). Driver should request the system controller to get the range
of global events and vints assigned to the requesting host. Management
of these requested resources should be handled by driver and requests
system controller to map specific global event to vint, bit pair.

Communication between the host processor running an OS and the system
controller happens through a protocol called TI System Control Interface
(TISCI protocol). For more details refer:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/keystone/ti,sci.txt

TISCI Interrupt Aggregator Node:
-------------------------------
- compatible:		Must be "ti,sci-inta".
- reg:			Should contain registers location and length.
- interrupt-controller:	Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells:	Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
			interrupt source. The value should be 4.
			First cell should contain the TISCI device ID of source
			Second cell should contain the event source offset
			within the device
			Third cell specified the vint number within IA.
			Fourth cell specifies the trigger type as defined
			in interrupts.txt in this directory.
- interrupt-parent:	phandle of irq parent for TISCI intr. The parent must
			use the same interrupt-cells format as GIC or
			Interrupt router as in ti,sci-intr.txt
- ti,sci:		Phandle to TI-SCI compatible System controller node.
- ti,sci-dev-id:	TISCI device ID of the Interrupt Aggregator.
- ti,sci-vint-type:	Tuple corresponding to unique TISCI resource type that
			defines the vint ranges assigned to the requesting
			host context from this Interrupt Aggregator.
			Tuple should be of format <type subtype>.
- ti,sci-global-event-type:	Tuple corresponding to unique TISCI resource
				type that defines the global event ranges
				assigned to the requesting host context from
				this Interrupt Aggregator.
				Tuple should be of format <type subtype>.

Optional Properties:
-------------------
Below properties are required only when interrupt parent is GIC.
- ti,sci-dst-id:	TISCI device ID of the destination IRQ controller.
- ti,sci-dst-irq-type:	Tuple corresponding to unique TISCI resource type that
			defines the dst host irq ranges assigned to this
			interrupt router from this host context.
			Tuple should be of format <type subtype>.


Example:
--------
main_udmass_inta: interrupt-controller@33d00000 {
	compatible = "ti,sci-inta";
	reg = <0x0 0x33d00000 0x0 0x100000>;
	interrupt-controller;
	interrupt-parent = <&main_navss_intr>;
	#interrupt-cells = <3>;
	ti,sci = <&dmsc>;
	ti,sci-dev-id = <179>;
	ti,sci-vint-type = <0x0 0x0>;
	ti,sci-global-event-type = <0x0 0x1>;
};
