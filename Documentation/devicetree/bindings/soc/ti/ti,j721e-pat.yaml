description: |
  A Page-based Address Translator (PAT) device performs address translation
  using tables stored in an internal SRAM. Each PAT supports a set number of
  pages, each occupying a programmable 4KB, 16KB, 64KB, or 1MB of addresses
  in a window for which an incoming transaction will be translated.
