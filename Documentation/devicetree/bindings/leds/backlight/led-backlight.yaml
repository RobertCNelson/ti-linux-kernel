description: |
  This binding is used to describe a basic backlight device made of LEDs.
  It can also be used to describe a backlight device controlled by the
  output of a LED driver.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: led-backlight

  leds:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/phandle-array
    description: List of LEDs constitutive of the backlight.

  default-brightness:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description: Default brightness level on boot.
    minimum: 0

  brightness-levels:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32-array
    description: Array of distinct brightness levels. The levels must be in
      the range accepted by the underlying LED devices. This is used to
      translate a backlight brightness level into a LED brightness level. If
      it is not provided, the identity mapping is used.

required:
  - compatible
  - backlight-leds

examples:
  - |
    backlight {
      compatible = "led-backlight";
      backlight-leds = <&led1>;
      brightness-levels = <0 4 8 16 32 64 128 255>;
      default-brightness = <6>; /*6th level => brightness of the LEDs is 128*/
    };
  - |
    backlight {
      compatible = "led-backlight";
      backlight-leds = <&led1>, <&led2>;
      default-brightness = <255>;
    };
