TI Keystone DSP Memory Mapping
==============================

Binding status: Unstable - ABI compatibility may be broken in the future

The Keystone DSP Memory Mapping binding defines the memory regions that
are reserved to be used with DSPs. These regions can be mapped into
userspace for providing direct user-mode access to these regions for the
purposes of shared memory communication with the DSP remote processor
devices on the SoC. These memory regions can also be used for supporting
user-space based loading of the DSP remoteproc devices.

The memory regions can either be from regular DDR memory or from the
On-chip RAM, and there can be one or more regions of each memory type.

DDR Memory usage (Optional):
----------------------------
One or more memory regions from DDR memory can be reserved specifically
to be used by the DSPs on the SoC. Each region should be defined as a
child node of the reserved-memory node with the following required
properties:

- compatible : Should be "ti,keystone-dsp-mem-pool"
- reg        : Should contain the region's start address and size following
               the #address-cells and #size-cells defined in the parent
               reserved-memory node.
- no-map     : Should be defined to remove this region from kernel

Please see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt
for more details on reserved-memory node.

SRAM usage (Optional):
----------------------
The On-chip Multicore Shared Memory (MSM) RAM can also be exposed to
userspace by defining specific child nodes under the corresponding parent
SRAM node. The generic SRAM binding is as per the binding document
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/misc/sram.txt. Following properties
should be used in each corresponding child node for the userspace mapping
usecase:

- compatible : Should be "ti,keystone-dsp-msm-ram"
- reg        : Should contain a pair of values for the address and size
               of the region, following the parent-child ranges convention.

Example:
--------
	/* 66AK2H EVM */
	reserved-memory {
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		ranges;

		dsp_common_mpm_memory: dsp-common-mpm-memory@820000000 {
			compatible = "ti,keystone-dsp-mem-pool";
			reg = <0x00000008 0x20000000 0x00000000 0x20000000>;
			no-map;
		};
	};

	soc {
		msm_ram: msmram@c000000 {
			compatible = "mmio-sram";
			reg = <0x0c000000 0x600000>;
			ranges = <0x0 0x0c000000 0x600000>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;

			sram-mpm@0 {
				compatible = "ti,keystone-dsp-msm-ram";
				reg = <0x0 0x80000>;
			};
		};
	};
